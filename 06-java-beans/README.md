06 Java Beans
=============
This lab is an extension of the previous.  Instead of using a Map to represent a person, create a Java Bean to hold this
information.  
* Name the class ChillDude.
* The bean should have two private final fields, `name`, and `age`.  
* `name` should be a String
* `age` should be an Integer. 
* Make getters for the fields.
* The constructor should assert that name and age are non-null and non-empty.
* Use Intellij to generate a hashCode and equals methods
* Copy your solution from 05 and replace the use of Maps with the new Bean
* Use the Stream API for Filter.
