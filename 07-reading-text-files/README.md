07 Reading Files
================
* Read the contents of a file into a Stream
* Collect the word counts into a Map
* Print the word occurrences
* Make sure to ignore errant spaces
* Make sure to ignore \n and \t

Hints
-----
* Use Path, not File.  File is "old IO".
* Look at the Files static class methods.
* Look at the FileSystems static class methods.
* Look at [Streams](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html)
* Set the working directory of your test to be your 07-reading-text-files dir.
