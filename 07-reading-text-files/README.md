07 Reading Files
================
* Read the contents of a file into a Stream
* Collect the word counts into a Map
* Print the word occurrences
* Make sure to ignore errant spaces
* Make sure to ignore \n and \t

Hints
-----
* Use Path, not File.  File is "old IO".
* Look at the Files static class methods.
* Look at the FileSystems static class methods.
